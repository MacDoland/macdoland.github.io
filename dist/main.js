This meant that the notion of pages in the traditional sense didn’t really exist as far as our team were concerned. We started to consider the site in terms of components, with a page being nothing more than a collection of those components.</p>\n\n                <p>In order to support that way of thinking we had to be very deliberate in our choice of technology stack.</p>\n\n                <p>Our stack includes:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Contentful - a headless CMS</li>\n                        <li>Content Service - a service layer built in Node.js</li>\n                        <li>React - our front end framework of choice</li>\n                        <li>Docker</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Using Contentful and our Content Service we have a lot of control and flexibility over how the data is presented to the application. We were able to define components and send over a detailed structure on how these components should be used by the application to create our pages. React lets us use this data and rapidly construct the visual components that the user sees on each page. Docker ensures that the application is packaged up and deployed with everything it needs to run which gives us confidence in our testing.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In the front end project we set up a container, a React specific piece of code, that requests the data from the content service for a certain page on the site. The data received includes a definition of what components should appear, the data for these components as well as some global data and site settings to populate the components that appear on every page.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Using React made a lot of sense here as components are front and center of it\'s ideology. We take the component definition list then dynamically render components based on this list in order. Each component follows the same rules and receives data in the same way. As we aren’t really concerned with pages, the focus is on building components in isolation, this makes splitting the work out between the team easier. </p>\n\n                <p>The benefits of our chosen architecture are that we are left with flexible pieces that are focused on their own concerns. We can add, edit or remove components, create entirely new pages and even decide to completely replace the front end solution with something different and the content remains unaffected. </p>\n                <p>\n                Relevant technologies: React, NodeJS, Contentful, Docker</p>\n\n                <p>Link: <a href="https://sailgp.com/">https://sailgp.com/</a></p>\n                ']},{id:"pila-game",title:"Prototype 3D Platformer",clientName:"Prototype 3D Platformer",imgUrl:"./dist/images/pila-background.jpg",type:"web",className:"pila-game-background",text:["\n                    <p>Pila and the secret door is one of the Unity projects I've been working on for fun in my own time. \n                    It's a 3D platformer that uses a custom kinematic character controller I've been writing that extends Unitys default one.</p>\n\n                    <p>I'm particularly fond of the compositional approach I've take where each behaviour is defined in a seperate game component.\n                    Although this comes with a slight performance cost, it has made life so much easier whe revisiting the project after extended breaks.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>I've recently begun refactoring the reusable elements such as this character controller and the camera into reusable unity packages imported via a git repository.</p>\n\n\n\n\n                "],overlayContent:'\n            \n            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/204263108" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n            \n            '},{id:"funeral",title:"SunLife Funeral Mapper",clientName:"SunLife",type:"web",className:"funeral-background",imgUrl:"./dist/images/funeral-mapper.png",highlighted:!0,text:['\n                    <p>SunLife were looking for a custom google map to help people plan services they would need during the death of a loved one.
